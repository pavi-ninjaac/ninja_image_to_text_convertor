# NiNja image to text convertor
  Let's have  a look at a wounderful  image to text convertor that extract the english words and digits in the images accuratlly. You can upload your
  images from your device and click the convert button to extract the text from the image. I used a simple OCR technique to do it. OCR means 
  optical charecter recognition technique for this python has a library called pytesseract. 
  
## Requreiments
1)opencv-for reading the image
2)pytesseract-extract the text for that
3)Flask-to make the UI(user Interface)
4)OS-to save,identify the system path of the image  in the system
